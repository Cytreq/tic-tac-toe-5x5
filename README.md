# tic-tac-toe-5x5
My tic-tac-toe 5x5 game implementation
In the MVP version of this project I implemented basic parts of the tic-tac-toe game like: 
- printing the boards
- making moves
- switching the player
- checking the draw and the win

In the future I want to add things that will make this game more adaptive such as: 
- custom board
- setting 
- player's symbols
